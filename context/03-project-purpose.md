# Project Purpose and Vision

## Primary Goal

This portfolio website supports Canadian job applications and Express Entry immigration by January 2026. It serves as a professional showcase demonstrating React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS skills while positioning the developer as someone actively growing into AI/robotics.

## Portfolio Strategy

### Immigration Context
- **Target**: Express Entry immigration by January 2026
- **Timeline**: Active job search and portfolio development
- **Strategy**: Demonstrate readiness and commitment to Canadian employers
- **Competitive advantage**: Immigration-ready status de-risks hiring decision

### Professional Positioning
- **Experience**: 3+ years full-stack web development
- **Growth trajectory**: Actively growing into AI/robotics
- **Skill demonstration**: Portfolio website itself proves React/TypeScript/Tailwind expertise
- **Diverse projects**: Showcases different skill facets (AI/ML, Enterprise, Robotics, Creative Engineering)

### Project Showcase Strategy
The portfolio will feature multiple projects, each targeting different job types:
- **WhatNow**: AI/ML companies, data science teams
- **Nexus**: Enterprise development, established tech companies
- **Atlantis**: Robotics, autonomous systems, underwater/space exploration
- **Lunascope**: Innovative companies valuing creativity + engineering, eco-tech, space agencies

## Theatrical Diorama Vision

### Hero Page Concept
The hero page will feature a series of rectangular arches with dioramas inside. Each diorama tells a visual story through layered depth, creating a theatrical, paper-cut aesthetic.

### Design Aesthetic
- **Shadow theatre**: Dark, muted surface layers creating depth
- **Paper lanterns**: Warm, glowing colors underneath
- **"Cut open" effect**: Dark, sleek tech surface revealing warm light
- **Clockwork animations**: Synchronized, mechanical timing

### Visual Metaphor
The diorama design creates a strong visual metaphor:
- **Dark surface (#0F1218)**: Professional, sleek, tech-like
- **Warm colors underneath**: Organic, theatrical, inviting
- **Layered depth**: Reveals complexity and craftsmanship
- **Animation**: Creates life and movement

## Design Philosophy

### Professional + Theatrical
The design balances professional tech aesthetics with warm, theatrical elements:
- Modern, sleek surface design
- Warm, organic colors underneath
- Mechanical, clockwork-like animations
- Paper-cut diorama craftsmanship

### "Cut Open" Effect
The dark surface appears to be "cut open" to reveal the warm paper lantern colors underneath. This creates:
- Strong visual contrast
- Sense of depth and revelation
- Professional surface with warm interior
- Visual storytelling through layers

### Each Diorama Tells a Story
Each diorama is a visual narrative:
- Layers create depth and complexity
- Entities (whales, characters) add life and movement
- Colors transition from dark to light
- Animations create rhythm and flow

## Future Goals

### Multiple Dioramas
- **Rectangular arches**: Hero page will feature multiple arch frames
- **Different shapes**: Support for rectangular dioramas (current is circular)
- **Various themes**: Different dioramas for different projects or concepts

### Entity Variety
- **Beyond whales**: Support for characters, objects, or other entities
- **Different animations**: Beyond rotation and scroll
- **Variable behaviors**: Entities can have unique animations per diorama

### Integration
- **Portfolio content**: Dioramas integrated with project pages, articles, blog series
- **Progressive disclosure**: Multiple content layers (cards → deep dives → stories → articles)
- **Blog patterns**: Tags, related articles, reading time, TOC, breadcrumbs

## Portfolio Context

### Ecosystem
This portfolio website is part of a larger portfolio-profile project ecosystem:
- **Chat records**: Stored in `/home/james/Documents/portfolio-profile/records/portfolio-website/`
- **Documentation**: Design documents, definitions, questionnaires in portfolio-profile project
- **Behaviors**: AI assistant behaviors defined in portfolio-profile project

### Skill Demonstration
The website itself demonstrates:
- **React + TypeScript**: Component architecture, type safety
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling, responsive design
- **System design**: Reusable, extensible architecture
- **Design thinking**: Aesthetic decisions and visual storytelling
- **Problem-solving**: Iterative refinement and refactoring

### Portfolio Value
This project shows:
- **Technical skills**: React, TypeScript, CSS, animation
- **Design skills**: Color theory, visual hierarchy, aesthetic judgment
- **System thinking**: Reusable architecture, configuration-driven approach
- **Iterative refinement**: Multiple iterations to achieve desired effect
- **Professional practices**: Type safety, code organization, documentation

## Key Design Decisions

### Reusable Component Architecture
**Decision**: Generic, reusable components over tightly-coupled implementations

**Why**: 
- Supports multiple diorama types
- Easy to create new dioramas
- Maintainable and extensible

**Result**: Clean separation between generic components and diorama-specific implementations

### Configuration-Driven Approach
**Decision**: Each diorama defines structure in a config file

**Why**:
- Easy to create new dioramas
- Centralized configuration
- Type-safe with TypeScript

**Result**: New dioramas can be created by defining configuration, not writing new components

### Theme Layer System
**Decision**: Global theme layer system mapping diorama layers to colors

**Why**:
- Consistent color mapping across dioramas
- Easy to adjust color palette globally
- Supports 11-layer depth system

**Result**: Unified color system that works across all dioramas

### Clockwork Durations
**Decision**: Predefined duration array for synchronized animations

**Why**:
- Creates mechanical, clockwork-like timing
- Ensures animations stay in sync
- Easy to adjust timing across diorama

**Result**: Synchronized animations that feel intentional and coordinated

### Component-Based Over Configuration-Only
**Decision**: Component-based architecture with hooks and utilities

**Why**:
- Better type safety with TypeScript
- React integration and lifecycle
- Easier to extend and customize

**Result**: Type-safe, React-native implementation that's easy to work with

## Design Evolution

### Color Palette Journey
1. **Initial**: User-provided hex values (rejected - didn't match vision)
2. **Celestial concept**: Dark muted top, riot of color underneath
3. **Refinement**: Dark tech surface, warm paper lantern colors
4. **Final**: #0F1218 surface transitioning to warm orange/yellow/cream spectrum

### Animation Evolution
1. **Initial**: Simple rotation and scroll
2. **Glow effect**: Attempted paper lantern glow (removed - not adding value)
3. **Staggered whales**: Different speeds and paths for natural appearance
4. **Current**: Refined timing and starting positions for optimal effect

### Architecture Evolution
1. **Initial**: Tightly-coupled ocean-specific components
2. **Refactoring**: Extracted reusable components, hooks, utilities
3. **Current**: Generic system ready for multiple diorama types

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- ✅ Reusable diorama system architecture
- ✅ Type-safe configuration
- ✅ Clean component separation
- ✅ Extensible for future dioramas

### Visual Success
