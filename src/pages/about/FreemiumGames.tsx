      <TextBlock
        sectionTitle="Octopus in a Fishbowl"
        text="It took me a while to break into the coding industry. I started out determined to be a game developer. Of course, the industry is very competitive, and I had one portfolio piece - a silly Unity game about an octopus in a fishbowl. It was a point and click game. The octopus would dart towards the mouse to eat bubbles, and it would inflate with each bubble until it was able to float out of the fishbowl and escape! I was living with my parents, I had no money, and I was absolutely terrified of having to go back to my retail job and never getting back out."
      />
      <TextBlock
        sectionTitle=""
        text="Months passed like this while I sent my very thin resume to any game dev company who'd take it. I wasn't a very good developer at this point, and if I went back in time with my current knowledge, I'm sure I would have gone about the whole thing in a more structured way. But I was still a kid and I flailed about the best I could, getting more and more panicked."
      />
      <TextBlock
        sectionTitle="One Invite"
        text="Eventually I got a response and an interview. It was just an invite to a Zoom call, but I'd never gotten an interview before. I sat staring at the one invite in my inbox, surrounded by rejections."
      />
      <TextBlock
        sectionTitle=""
        text="I was a mess before the call - so nervous I would mess it up, or that they'd realize how little experience I had. But the interview went well! He seemed excited to meet me, interested in my enthusiasm. I would be part of a team of game developers making a mobile game. It sounded absolutely perfect! It was finally a chance to get some experience in game development, and maybe it was the start of a whole career. I could finish this game, and then when I went job hunting again I would have a much better resume because someone had taken a chance on me. Maybe I'd get to work on one of my childhood games like Pokemon, or one of the huge cinematic games like The Last of Us!"
      />
      <TextBlock
        sectionTitle=""
        text="It was finally worth holding out for so long, for not giving up on my dream. I was being given a chance."
      />
      <TextBlock
        sectionTitle="Treehouse Base"
        text="We were talking about the game itself when he mentioned that it had some payment features. I paused, not wanting to ask but knowing I had to. Was it a freemium game?"
      />
      <TextBlock
        sectionTitle=""
        text="He nodded and tried to move quickly on, but my stomach dropped. I know that doesn't sound like a big thing - like maybe I was disappointed by the lack of glamour - but that wasn't it. Freemium games are toxic. They use slot machine tactics to prey on the tiny percentage of players with that kind of addiction, and they take almost all of their profits from those few. They're predatory."

      <TextBlock
        sectionTitle=""
        text="Games were sacred to me. They were a huge part of my childhood - glimpses into different lives, different worlds. Getting to pretend to be a hero, to go on adventures. They taught values and grit and imagination. Pokemon and Legend of Zelda had as much of an impact on me as any person did. I remember loving the idea of being in my treehouse base in Pokemon Sapphire, camping out with my team of Pokemon, planning out our next raid on Team Aqua. Of exploring the world, diving to the bottom of the ocean, fighting to the top of a volcano, utterly unstoppable. They were why I wanted to work on games in the first place - the chance to inspire someone else like that, to be a bright light in someone else's childhood. And like all stories, games help shape the culture. They're a very real force in making people want to be better."
      />
      <TextBlock
        sectionTitle=""
        text="Freemium games went against all of that, preying on the people they were meant to inspire."

      <TextBlock
        sectionTitle="Lead and Acid"
        text="But... this felt like my only chance. The one opportunity I might get to be part of the industry. It had already been months, and how much damage could one game do really?"
      />
      <TextBlock
        sectionTitle=""
        text="I declined. Even if it meant I never had another chance, I couldn't do it. I wanted to make games because they mattered to me, and this would go against all of that. It felt like giving up an entire future, but I ended the interview early and walked away."
      />
      <TextBlock
        sectionTitle=""
        text="My stomach felt like it was filled with lead and acid. I couldn't do anything else that day, sure that I'd just destroyed my own future."
      />
      <TextBlock
        sectionTitle="Who You Are Walking Into It"
        text="It's hard in the moment to know if you made the right call. My philosophy has always been that you can't choose your future, but you can choose who you are walking into it. I knew that accepting the job would have meant being someone I didn't like or respect anymore."
      />
      <TextBlock
        sectionTitle=""
        text="It's the same choice I've made multiple times in my life - that quiet afterwards where the fear of not knowing what came next mixed with the pride of staying true to myself. It wasn't the end of that career. A few weeks later, I stumbled onto another job acting as a volunteer for a small games company, and this one I accepted."
