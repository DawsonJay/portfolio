      <TextBlock text="I've been described as 'team dad' - someone who naturally brings people together and encourages everyone to be their best. This isn't about authority or control; it's about creating an environment where genuine connection and collaboration can flourish. I believe the best teams are small (3-4 people), make decisions through consensus, and share ownership of the project and its success." sectionTitle="Natural Leadership" />
      <TextBlock text="My approach to leadership is rooted in authentic presence and leading by example. I don't perform for validation or try to shape how others see me. Instead, I show up aligned with my values, share my vision and passion for projects, and help people see the meaning and brilliance in what we're building together. This authenticity creates a ripple effect - when people see genuine commitment, they're inspired to match it." sectionTitle="Leading by Example" />
      <TextBlock text="One of my core beliefs about people is that everyone can learn and improve. I have rock-solid confidence in a person's ability to grow, which shapes how I collaborate and teach. When I pair-programmed with backend developers learning CSS, I wasn't just transferring knowledge - I was creating a safe space where they felt comfortable asking questions and experimenting. That confidence in others is what helps them believe in themselves." sectionTitle="Teaching & Support" />
      <TextBlock text="I'm more motivated to do great work when I know it'll help my team. This might seem simple, but it fundamentally changes how I approach challenges. When I find an elegant solution or learn something valuable, my first thought is how to share it with teammates who'll appreciate it. This creates those 'bright sparks' - moments of genuine shared excitement over a breakthrough or clever approach." sectionTitle="Collaborative Drive" />
      <TextBlock text="The kind of team I thrive in values results over process, shares my commitment to meaningful work, and operates with mutual respect and autonomy. I need teammates who understand that how we work together matters as much as what we build. In return, I bring creativity, strategic thinking, honest communication, and a deep investment in the team's success and growth." sectionTitle="Ideal Collaboration" />
