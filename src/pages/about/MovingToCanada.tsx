      <TextBlock text="My decision to pursue Canadian immigration isn't just about career opportunities - it's about finding a place where my values align with the broader culture. Canada's reputation for environmental consciousness, community focus, and innovation in sustainable technology resonates deeply with my own priorities. I'm drawn to a country that seems to understand the importance of balancing progress with preservation." sectionTitle="Values Alignment" />
      <TextBlock text="I've completed my IELTS (8.5 overall) and WES credential assessment, demonstrating my commitment to this path. Building this portfolio is part of the same journey - I want to work with Canadian companies that share my approach to technology: thoughtful, sustainable, focused on genuine value rather than just growth for its own sake. I'm not looking for any job; I'm looking for the right fit." sectionTitle="Immigration Journey" />
      <TextBlock text="What I bring to Canadian teams is a unique blend of creativity, technical skill, and values-driven leadership. I can build AI systems that learn and adapt, create component architectures that scale, lead teams through genuine connection and collaboration. But more importantly, I bring authenticity and a deep commitment to work that matters. I'm someone who turns down opportunities that don't align with my values, even when it's difficult." sectionTitle="What I Offer" />
      <TextBlock text="I envision contributing to projects in robotics, environmental technology, space exploration, or sustainable systems - work that helps restore humanity's relationship with the world. I want to be part of small, passionate teams where everyone brings their full selves to the work. I thrive in environments that value results over process, trust over micromanagement, and authentic presence over performance." sectionTitle="Canadian Vision" />
      <TextBlock text="This move represents a strategic career decision toward meaningful work in a values-driven environment. Canada offers opportunities in areas I'm passionate about while providing a culture that aligns with how I want to live and work. I'm not just seeking immigration - I'm seeking partnership with companies and teams who share my vision for what technology can and should be." sectionTitle="Long-Term Partnership" />
