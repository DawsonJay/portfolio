      <TextBlock text="My fundamental values operate like binary stars - two equal forces orbiting each other, neither primary, both essential. Wonder and Connection aren't separate values competing for priority; they're intrinsically linked, feeding and sustaining each other in a continuous dance. This framework shapes every decision I make, from the projects I pursue to how I show up in teams." sectionTitle="The Framework" />
      <TextBlock text="Wonder is about seeing the beauty within things - in people, in nature, in ideas, in the world itself. It's the awe I feel looking at stars, the appreciation for a well-crafted piece of code, the recognition of brilliance in a colleague's solution. Wonder drives my curiosity and fuels my passion for technology, art, and the natural world." sectionTitle="Wonder" />
      <TextBlock text="Connection is the natural complement to wonder - it's about sharing that awe, experiencing it together, appreciating it in others. Connection manifests as empathy, love, acceptance, and genuine presence. It's not just about connecting with people, but also with the world around us - with nature, ecology, time, and our place in the universe." sectionTitle="Connection" />
      <TextBlock text="These values create what I call 'bright sparks' - genuine moments of connection that happen through shared wonder. When I teach a colleague something new and see their eyes light up with understanding, when a team celebrates a breakthrough together, when we're all awestruck by an elegant solution - these are the moments that matter. They're brief but meaningful, and they're what I actively work to create." sectionTitle="Bright Sparks" />
      <TextBlock text="In my work, this framework means I'm drawn to projects that inspire wonder - whether it's AI systems that learn and adapt, robotics that explore new environments, or sustainable technologies that help us reconnect with nature. But I'm equally focused on building these projects with teams where genuine connection and collaboration create something greater than any individual could achieve alone." sectionTitle="In Practice" />
