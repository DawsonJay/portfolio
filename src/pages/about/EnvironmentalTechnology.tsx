      <TextBlock text="One of my driving motivations is helping restore humanity's relationship with the natural world. We've become disconnected from the earth, treating it as a resource to exploit rather than as something to cherish and protect. Technology alone can't fix this - but it can be a tool for reconnection, for sharing wonder, for helping people experience and appreciate the natural world in new ways." sectionTitle="Core Vision" />
      <TextBlock text="I'm drawn to technologies that serve nature rather than dominate it: moss panels that filter air while bringing greenery into urban spaces, organic solar panels that mimic natural processes, cardboard drones that minimize environmental impact, underwater robots that help us explore without disturbing fragile ecosystems. These aren't just clever engineering - they're expressions of a different relationship with technology." sectionTitle="Sustainable Innovation" />
      <TextBlock text="My interest in space and deep sea exploration comes from the same place. These technologies share wonder about the universe and our planet with people who couldn't otherwise experience them. An underwater drone that can explore sunken ruins or document marine life doesn't just gather data - it creates moments of shared awe. A telescope that makes distant stars accessible brings people into connection with the cosmos." sectionTitle="Exploration Technology" />
      <TextBlock text="I believe change happens through community and culture, not through grand technological solutions imposed from above. The small good things stack up: a person learning to garden through a community app, children experiencing wonder through accessible astronomical tools, teams choosing sustainable materials for their robotics projects. Leading by example has a ripple effect that can spark deep change." sectionTitle="Community Change" />
      <TextBlock text="This is why I want to work on environmental technology, conservation tools, sustainable farming systems, or exploration projects that help people connect with nature. I want to build things that serve the world, not just exploit it. Technology guided by wonder and connection, designed to bring people back into relationship with the earth and each other." sectionTitle="Future Direction" />
