      <TitleBlock title="From Art to Technology" />
      <TextBlock text="My journey into technology began in an unexpected place - an art foundation course at the University of Derby. I was passionate about illustration and visual storytelling, excelling particularly in visual technologies and creative skills. But during my time at university, I discovered something important: the things I loved about art - dreaming up projects and making them real - weren't unique to creative disciplines." sectionTitle="Early Foundations" />
      <TextBlock text="After my foundation year, I pursued AI at Heriot-Watt University, driven by curiosity about how machines could learn and adapt. However, I quickly realized that traditional university education wasn't serving my learning goals. I went to university to learn, but found it was more about earning a degree than genuine understanding. This realization led me to leave and pursue a more direct path into technology." sectionTitle="Strategic Pivot" />
      <TextBlock text="In 2020, I completed an intensive web development bootcamp at Ironhack, learning React, TypeScript, Express, and full-stack development practices. This marked my formal transition into professional development, but the real learning came from building projects - from recommendation systems to component libraries to environmental technology concepts. Each project taught me more about the craft than any course could." sectionTitle="Bootcamp & Beyond" />
      <TextBlock text="What makes my path unique is that I never really left art behind - I just found that technology offers the same creative fulfillment. Building a self-training AI system requires the same vision and creativity as designing an illustration. Architecting a component system demands the same attention to beauty and elegance as visual composition. The mediums changed, but the core drive remained constant." sectionTitle="The Connection" />
      <TextBlock text="Today, I bring both perspectives to my work. My artistic background gives me an eye for design, user experience, and elegant solutions. My technical skills let me build systems that actually work. But more importantly, both disciplines taught me the same lesson: the best work comes from balancing vision with practicality, creativity with functionality, wonder with connection." sectionTitle="Unified Approach" />
