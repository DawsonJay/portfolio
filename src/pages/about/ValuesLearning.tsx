      <TextBlock text="My learning approach is fundamentally goal-driven and values-aligned. I don't learn technologies for their own sake or chase trends to pad a resume. Instead, my goals determine what I learn. When I want to build an underwater exploration robot, I learn the robotics, embedded systems, and control theory needed to make it real. When I want to create a recommendation system, I dive into machine learning and contextual bandits." sectionTitle="Goal-Driven Approach" />
      <TextBlock text="This makes my career path look unconventional - art to AI to web development to robotics - but there's a consistent thread: I'm always pursuing projects that align with my values of wonder and connection. CSS becomes fascinating when I'm teaching it to backend developers and seeing them gain confidence. React architecture becomes engaging when I'm building component systems that help teams collaborate more effectively." sectionTitle="Following Values" />
      <TextBlock text="I frame problems by understanding limits first, then finding creative solutions within those constraints. When resources are scarce, you have to turn to cleverness and creativity - and that's where the most interesting work happens. This approach means I'm comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty, as long as the ultimate goal aligns with something meaningful." sectionTitle="Problem-Solving Method" />
      <TextBlock text="My learning style emphasizes iteration and continuous improvement. I teach basic principles and work up, encouraging small improvements over time. I'm patient with myself and others, understanding that mastery comes from practice and reflection, not from cramming facts. This is why I prefer hands-on projects over traditional coursework - real problems teach faster than textbooks." sectionTitle="Continuous Growth" />
      <TextBlock text="Looking forward, my learning priorities are shaped by the work I want to do: environmental technology, robotics and automation, sustainable systems, AI that learns and adapts, exploration tools that share wonder. Each project I choose opens up new areas to explore, always guided by the question: will this help me build things that matter?" sectionTitle="Future Learning" />
